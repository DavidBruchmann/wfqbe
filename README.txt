This is an adjusted version of the extension wfqbe

The orginal version is available here:
https://github.com/TYPO3-svn-archive/wfqbe

An already adjusted Version is included here as 1st and 2nd commit
and was done by https://github.com/woepwoep
and is available here:
https://github.com/woepwoep/wfqbe76

The version available here has many many changes and is still under development.
The structure changed very much, many classes have been defined as extension
for extbase.
This repository is aimed to serve for further development.
Pullrequests and issues will be handled if I find the time.
Feel free to fork the repo.

With TYPO3 Version 7 the database abstraction has been depreacated and the whole 
database usage in wfqbe has to be changed for usage for TYPO3 Version 9.
Therefore the development is getting quite a lot of work and it might be
questionable if and how all the old features can be realized in future.
